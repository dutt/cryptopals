The Strike Leader considered him for a moment, and then nodded. “As you wish. General, my perspective is somewhat different from yours. A mercenary fights for pay, and nothing more. The banner they fight beneath, the faction they support, these are questions best left to others, for if a sellsword spends too much time considering them, he is no longer effective. You, on the other hand, are a patriot, fighting for a cause, and while your cause and mine are joined, it does give me a certain...detachment. Perhaps even some small measure of objectivity.”

“Is there a point you’re coming to, Ihorokk?” the General said impatiently.

“Simply this...that much of my previous employment was repeat business. Side A would hire the Legions, and then some time later Side B would do the same. Back, and forth. Revenge is good for business when one is a mercenary...but that does not describe you.” He shrugged once again. “What we do today will have consequences, and once a bullet is fired, it cannot be recalled.”

“So you’re saying we shouldn’t crush the Erialyichi,” he snapped, “after all they've done?”

“No General, I am saying be certain of your motives...and be willing to accept the repercussions,” Ihorokk said evenly. “For if at some point in the future blame is placed on what happens next...that blame will land on you, and you alone.”
